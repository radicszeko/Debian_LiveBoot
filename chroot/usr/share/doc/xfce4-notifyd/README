Xfce Notify Daemon

The Xfce Notify Daemon (xfce4-notifyd for short) is a smallish program that
implements the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications
specification.  Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in
a standard way can implicitly make use of xfce4-notifyd to do so by
sending standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications
interface.


Requirements:

* gtk+ 3.14.0
* glib-2.0 (gdbus) 2.42
* libxfce4util 4.12.0
* libxfce4ui 4.12.0
* xfconf 4.10
* libnotify 0.7

Additionally, I'd recommend use with a compositing manager running; in that
case xfce4-notifyd will look a bit nicer and will be semi-transparent and
will fade out, and other nice pretty things.  This isn't required by any
means, of course.


Installation:

The usual:

./configure
make
make install

should work just fine.  Pass --prefix=/path/to/wherever to install in a
location other than /usr/local.

In order for xfce4-notifyd to be started automatically, you must have a
<servicedir> directive in your D-Bus session configuration file.  If you
install xfce4-notifyd to a standard prefix (like /usr), you shouldn't need
to worry about this.


Configuration:

Run xfce4-notifyd-config to display the settings dialog.  There aren't any
other tunables; if you don't see it in the settings dialog, it's not
changeable.


Theming:

Xfce4-notifyd uses Gtk+'s standard theming system. By default it will use the
"app-notification" or "osd" classes of your Gtk+ theme. If you want to override
the default notifications style of your theme by referencing the
"#XfceNotifyWindow" widget name or you can either create a separate standalone
theme (see the examples provided, e.g. "ZOMG-PONIES!").
You'll want to put your gtk css file in $HOME/.themes/THEMENAME/xfce4-notify-4.0
and then start up the configuration dialog to set the theme. If you think
you've come up with a cool theme, feel free to send it to me, and I'll be happy
to include it in the next release. For themes shipped with xfce4-notifyd, I
require all parts of them to be redistributable under the terms of a license
compatible with the GPLv2.
